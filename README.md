Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Project
This project focuses on converting spoken language to text (Speech-to-Text) and generating spoken language from text (Text-to-Speech). It includes several Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the approaches and implementations for these tasks.

Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to build applications for speech recognition and synthesis. The goal is to create a system that can transcribe spoken words into written text and generate speech from text inputs.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:

text2speect_speech2text.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that combines both Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech functionalities. It demonstrates the integration and usage of these technologies in a single workflow.
Speech2Text Approach.ipynb: This notebook focuses on the Speech-to-Text aspect, showcasing different methods and models used to transcribe audio inputs into text.
TTS.ipynb: The Text-to-Speech notebook, which illustrates the process of generating speech from text inputs. It includes examples and code for converting text to audio.
Installation
To run the notebooks and reproduce the results, you need to set up a Python environment with the required packages. Follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-to-text-text-to-speech.git
cd speech-to-text-text-to-speech
Create a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Additional Setup:

Ensure you have the necessary audio drivers and libraries installed (e.g., portaudio, ffmpeg).
Usage
Running the Notebooks:

Start Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the desired notebook (text2speect_speech2text.ipynb, Speech2Text Approach.ipynb, or TTS.ipynb) and follow the instructions within the notebook cells to run the code and see the results.
Examples:

Speech-to-Text: Upload an audio file or use a sample to see how the system transcribes speech into text.
Text-to-Speech: Enter text input and generate audio output using the TTS system.
